    <h1>We are very dedicated</h1>
    <p>The company was founded in 1994 in Sweden by Christian von Koenigsegg, with the intention of producing a "world-class" sports car. Many years of development and testing led to the CC8S, the company's first street-legal production car which was introduced in 2002 <br>

        In 2006, Koenigsegg began production of the CCX, which uses an engine created in-house specifically for the car. The goal was to develop a car homologated for use worldwide, particularly the United States whose strict regulations did not allow the import of earlier Koenigsegg models. <br>
        
        In March 2009, the CCXR was listed by Forbes as one of "the world's most beautiful cars". <br>
        
        In December 2010, the Agera won the BBC Top Gear Hypercar of the Year Award.</p>
